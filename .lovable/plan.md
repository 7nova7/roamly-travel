# Deploy Edge Functions

## Steps

1. Deploy both `generate-itinerary` and `recommend-stays` edge functions (the type fix from the last edit should resolve the previous build error).
2. Check latest logs for both functions to confirm they booted successfully.

No code changes needed -- just deployment and log verification.
